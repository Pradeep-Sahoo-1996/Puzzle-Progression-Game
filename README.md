# Puzzle-Progression-Game (Got Assignment from an Online Source)

For this I prepared a detailed report for this game; on how to test and what is measured part of this game and 
what test will do before release...

this is a description of a game. Go through it carefully and
send us the following
1. A list of all parts of the software that will need to be tested.
For example
a. UI/UX
b. Data etc
2. Write some test cases for the gameplay part of the software.
They do not have to be very detailed but aim for maximum
coverage in what you are discussing
3. Share a list of the assumptions that you have made (If any)
4. Also make a list of tests that will need to be successful to be
able to release the game.
